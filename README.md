# Cyberpunk RED

An in-development system for Cyberpunk RED. Since the game is not yet released, this is obviously not intended for use yet.

# Important Note

This system doesn't yet work, though it should in the next week or two.

# Features Planned

- Character Sheet
  1. All attributes and skills easily visible
  2. Special tab to make various combat actions easier to manage (or drag to action bar)
  3. Additional tabs that show or hide based on your selection of available abilities (hacking, etc...)
- NPCs
  1. Special system to help make using large number of NPCs easier
  2. Options at the game level to define how necessary the battle grid is to the play of the game (See below)
- Other
  - Other design decisions about the table, dice rolling, etc... are still beging made
  
# General Design Plans

Since playstyles vary greatly, this sheet is designed with the following in mind:

1. Everything important about a character or NPC should work just fine without using tokens, maps, action bars, or anyting else.
   - Some people just want to play the game using their mind and their own internal vision, we want to support that style of play. If all the players and GM want to use is the character sheet, this should not limit the usefullness of the system in any way.
2. Everything should be efficient and quick during play. Nothing should require multiple clicks if we can find a way to do it with just one.
3. Help text and tips should be available at the beginning, but hidable with a simple setting change.
